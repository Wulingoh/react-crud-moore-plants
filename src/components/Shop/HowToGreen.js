                    Plants basically want sunlight. Some varieties grow
                    relatively well in poorly lit areas, but manage them in a
                    bright room with at least windows. Depending on the species,
                    manage cacti and succulents in a particularly sunny place in
                    your home.

                    Ventilation is very important for plants. By sending fresh
                    air with the wind, it grows strong and helps prevent soil
                    from getting stuffy. It is strictly forbidden to blow air
                    conditioning. The leaves will lose their energy due to
                    dryness and temperature change

                    Watering varies by season and variety, but what they have in
                    common is to keep the best timing and to give the right
                    amount to the soil. Let's give water while being conscious
                    of sharpness. It is necessary to pay attention to whether
                    the water in the saucer is left in the pool. In dry areas,
                    spray the leaves frequently.

                    It is a pot suitable for planting because it has excellent
                    ventilation and drainage. When planting, choose one with a
                    pot hole. It gives warmth to the interior with the
                    atmosphere unique to pottery. It has the advantage of being
                    heavy and does not easily fall over, but you need to be
                    careful not to drag the bottom when moving.

                    You can enjoy the relaxing interior unique to pot covers
                    made of wood, vines, bark and fibers. Pots made from plant
                    fibers also have the advantage of being lightweight. Most of
                    them are waterproof, but they deteriorate when water
                    accumulates, so use a saucer.
